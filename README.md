# Monitorify

Monitorify is a simple monitoring application build on [CheryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) by [23](http://www.23company.com) to monitor, track and profile web services.

This scheme allows different web services to expose a set of tests and metrics to the central monitoring service via HTTP and in a standardized JSON document. Metrics are tracked and visualized at set intervals, while tests are carried out and reported.
